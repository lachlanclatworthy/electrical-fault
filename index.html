        <p>Articles have been filed</p>
        <h2>Regarding arrangements...</h2>
        <p>We really ought to have discussed this beforehand,
        but I believe it's in <b>both</b> our best interests
        if you remain seated and keep your mouth shut.<br>
        <i>There are agents in the vicinity.</i></p>
        <em>
        Practically speaking, we have no agency in these affairs.
